Let's go ahead and create the Department table:

```
CREATE TABLE department(
department_number integer CONSTRAINT department_number_pk PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY ,
Department_name VARCHAR (50) constraint department_ak UNIQUE NOT NULL
);```{{execute}}

Let's review the depatment table structure:

```\d department```{{execute}}

- `department_number`
    - This field uses the data type INTEGER. The GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY constraint also instructs PostgreSQL to generate a value for the identity column. That said, if you provide a value for insert or update, PostgreSQL will use the specified value to insert into the identity column instead of the system-generated value.
    - `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` also uses the SEQUENCE object internally. This syntax was introduced with PostgreSQL 10 to be more compliant with SQL standards.
    - A PRIMARY KEY constraint named `department_number_pk` is also added.
- `department_name`
    - This field uses the `varchar` data type, where the character limit is 50.
    - A UNIQUE constraint `department_ak` is specified. This field must also have a not null value.

Let's continue.
