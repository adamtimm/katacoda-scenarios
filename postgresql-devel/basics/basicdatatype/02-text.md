Postgres has three built-in character types:

* `character` (or `char`) - fixed length
* `character varying` (or `varchar`) - variable length with limit
* `text` - variable unlimited length

Declaring a `char` or `varchar` type when creating a new table looks like this:

```
CREATE TABLE texttable (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY, 
    chara1 char(8), 
    chara2 varchar(32))
;
```{{execute}}

The `n` in `char(n)` and `varchar(n)` must be a positive integer, and 
represents the maximum number of characters in the string. More than the 
maximum will cause an error when attempting to save, unless the excess 
characters are spaces.

If the `n` isn't specified for `char`, it is interpreted as `char(1)`. If the 
`n` isn't specified for `varchar` it will store strings of any length (as does 
`text`).

For `char`, the string is padded up to n characters if the length is shorter 
than n. For `varchar`, strings shorter than n are stored as is.

### Which character type to use

While in other DBMS's there might be key differences between `char` and 
`varchar`, there are generally no substantial differences in performance 
between them (as well as `text`) in Postgres. 

`varchar` and `text` are preferred and more commonly used. If you need to limit
 the number of characters, use the `varchar(n)` syntax, or use a check 
 constraint with `text`. You might consider `char` if you know that your values
 will _always_ have a fixed number of characters - less than 3 characters might
  be a valid use case: for example, US state abbreviations. Otherwise, for 
  most cases, even if you need to limit the length, you're better off using 
  `varchar` or `text`.

The `text` type is specific to Postgres and is not part of the SQL standard.

### Add text values to a table

Let's try adding a few rows of values:

```
INSERT INTO texttable (chara1, chara2)
VALUES  ('55', 'Blue'),
        ('202004', 'Lavender'),
        ('1510', 'Magenta'),
        ('4132', 'Blue, Lavender, Magenta, Emerald')
;

SELECT * FROM texttable;
```{{execute}}
