While we've now dipped our toes into some of the "advanced" data types 
supported in Postgres, we want to mention a few that we didn't include in this 
course:

### JSON

Postgres supports JSON, and there are two types for storing JSON data: `json`, 
and `jsonb`. To get your feet wet with these two types, and to learn a little 
more about why `jsonb` would be preferable, check out our [Intro to JSON in 
PostgreSQL course](../../beyond-basics/qjsonintro/) right here in the 
Learning Portal.

### Text search

Postgres provides data types to support full text search: `tsvector` and 
`tsquery`. Learn more in our [Intro to Full Text Search in 
PostgreSQL](../../beyond-basics/qftextintro/) course.

### User-defined types

You also have the ability to create your own custom data types in Postgres. To 
do so, you could use the [CREATE TYPE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtype.html) 
statement (which you'll recall we used to create our enum type), or [CREATE 
DOMAIN](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdomain.html). You 
could even go as far as creating your own [custom base 
types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xtypes.html), if necessary.
