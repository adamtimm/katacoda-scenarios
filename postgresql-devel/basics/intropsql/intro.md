# Introduction to Using the Command Line with PostgreSQL

`psql` is a command line tool that is included with a PostgreSQL install. It lets you run queries and scripts, manage databases, and interact with the computer using a command-line client.

The advantage of using the command line is that it can save you time - entering short text commands might be even faster than clicking through a graphical user interface (GUI), especially as you become more and more comfortable with the command line. Additionally, there are some functions that you can perform only in the command line. You can even use psql within a shell script, allowing you to execute multiple commands together and automate repetitive tasks.

1. Username: groot
