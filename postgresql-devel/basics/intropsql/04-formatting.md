## Formatting results using `\pset`

Sometimes, your query might return a long list of results. The following statement, for example, returns over 55,000 rows:

```
SELECT  state,
        month_name,
        event_type
FROM se_details;
```{{execute}}

Remember that you can press `q` any time to return to the `psql` prompt.

You can use the `\pset` command to customize the way results are displayed. 

Instead of having to scroll through the entire result set, you can instead have the terminal take you automatically to the end:

`\pset pager`{{execute}}

Running this command without a value (i.e. `\pset pager on` or `off`) toggles the pager use on or off. Try executing the SELECT query above again.

`\pset` also has other options you can use to format the results display. Try running `\pset border 0` and `\pset border 2` to see how each one changes the display
when executing the query above.

```
\pset border 0
```{{execute}}

```
\pset border 2
```{{execute}}

Note: There is also an option to set these preferences in a [startup file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html#id-1.9.4.18.10), which can be run each time `psql` starts.
