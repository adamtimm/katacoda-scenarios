## Introduction to `psql`

`psql` is described in the [docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/app-psql.html) as a "terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL." This means that instead of having to use a GUI tool such as [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to create, access, or manipulate a database, you can use text commands via a command line interface (CLI).

We'll get started by connecting to a database.

### Connect to the `workshop` database  

The database contains storm events data, which is public domain data from the National Weather Service.

In your interactive terminal, you're currently logged in as root user, as indicated by the command line prompt:

> **Note**

> Depending on the system you're using and the shell (i.e. program you're in),
> the prompt might look a little different. You'll see this below when you're
> in the `psql` shell.

We want to connect to the PostgreSQL database as **groot**, so we'll enter the `psql` command, accompanied by some flags:

```
psql -h localhost -U groot -d workshop
```{{execute}}

Each command line flag or option begins with a `-` or `--`, and what follows after the space is the parameter you're passing in with the command.

1. The `-h` option specifies the host server (e.g. `localhost`), or socket directory.
2. `-U` specifies the user you're connecting as (`groot`).
3. `-d` specifies the database you're connecting to (`workshop`).

The CLI shows a response whenever a command is run. In this case, since you are logging in to a database as the user **groot**, the command line will then prompt you for the password (enter `password`). You won't see the password displayed as you type, but the terminal is recording your keystrokes.

Once you're logged in to the database server, the prompt in the terminal should change. The psql prompt indicates the database you're connected to, along with `=>`.

The beauty of the command line is that there are often shortcuts or tips and tricks. For example, you could shorten the command used above even further to:

`psql -h localhost workshop groot`
