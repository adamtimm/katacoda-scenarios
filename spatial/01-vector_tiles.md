Vector tiles are a bandwidth efficient method of transferring spatial data over the web for display in webmaps. For a brief history of webmaps and vector tiles, watch [Paul Ramsey's presentation at PostGIS Day 2019](https://youtu.be/t8eVmNwqh7M "PostGIS Day 2019 Vector Tiles"). 

The original method for generation and serving of vector tiles involved some type of batch data processing of the vector tiles and then hosting those in a web cache. Depending on the amount of data, this process could be time consuming. Additionally, if your dataset is constantly changing, or only changes slightly, you are doing a lot of processing on data that hasn't changed, just to update a small part of the dataset. 

With the release of PostGIS 2.4, PostGIS introduced the ability to generate vector tiles directly from the database. This provided developers with the ability to have constantly up-to-date vector tiles in their webmap. However, it required the developers to write their own API to leverage this functionality. Pg_tileserv was created to make it easy to service enable your spatial data and integrate it into your web application.
